# WP Engine Selenium User Portal Access Logs Automator

This Python script uses Selenium and Chromedrive to pull WP Engine Complete Access Logs for last 2 calendar days.
Dependencies: `python3`, `pip`, `selenium`, `chromedriver`

## To Use:

Simply clone the repo and open `init.sh` in your chosen terminal client and follow the instructions.

## Roadmap

Currently for WP Engine internal use only, so OKTA credentials and appropriate LDAP permission-sets are required. Will be building in logic for more general authentication in next version.
